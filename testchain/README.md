## Test Chain

This comprises the node and the runtime, from Parity's [substrate-contracts-node](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-contracts-node#substrate-contracts-node).

---
To run the test node:
1. In the root folder, execute: `cargo b --release`.
2. Check existence in the __target/release__ folder for `pendulum-test-node`.
3. Then execute: `target/release/pendulum-test-node --dev`
